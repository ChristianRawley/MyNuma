# MyNuma: The better MyUAFS Sucessor
MyNuma is an easy alternative to the otherwise difficult-to-traverse [my.uafs.edu](https://my.uafs.edu/) website. It is feauture rich with content spanning several different official resources, all in one *beautiful* mobile app.

If you have any questions about the project or myself, you can always email me at christianrawley0@gmail.com (personal) or crawle00@uafs.edu (university).
